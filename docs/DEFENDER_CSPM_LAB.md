\# Defender for Cloud (CSPM) Lab



1\) Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud

\- Portal → Defender for Cloud → Environment settings → turn on for your subscription (at least the CSPM plan)

\- Wait for recommendations to populate (can be minutes to hours)



2\) Map Policies to Secure Score

\- Open \*\*Recommendations\*\* and \*\*Secure Score\*\*

\- Identify items your policies address (e.g., Storage diagnostics enabled)

\- Take screenshots



3\) Export Evidence

\- Defender for Cloud → Secure Score → Export (CSV or PDF)

\- Attach to your `docs/AUDIT\_EVIDENCE\_TEMPLATE.md` as evidence



4\) Talking points

\- CSPM provides continuous baseline assessment

\- Azure Policy + Initiatives align to CIS/NIST controls

\- Third-party CSPM (Prisma/Wiz/etc.) can add multi-cloud and agentless discovery
